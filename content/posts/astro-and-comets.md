## 2024-10-21: Finally the comet was seen!

The maximum brightness was missed due to cloudy weather. At a
[magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)) of 4.4 the observation was difficult to the naked eyes.
[Dark-adaption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye)) and
[averted-vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averted_vision) helped a lot, and of course the optical tools:
* 8x20 Trinovid binocular
* 10" [Dobsonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope)  with 2" wide-angle
  [Erfle-eyepiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece#Erfle), two degree
  [field-of-view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view)
* [DSLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera)  on a tripod, using a fixed focal length
  [50mm-Planar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss_Planar)  (f/1,7), which acts as 75mm due to CropFactor.

## [C/2023 A3 ]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS) ) &nbsp;  [Tsuchinshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Mountain_Observatory) - [ATLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_Terrestrial-impact_Last_Alert_System)

[Ephemerides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris)  as
[right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension) and
[declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system#Declination) :

    RA: 16h 44m, DE: +02° 42' with 22° Elevation aka Altitude.

The following foto spans about 25 horizontal degrees.
The visible part of the tail is estimated to about 3 degrees.
On the left border near the bottom "µ [Ophiuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiuchus)" is located.
The four little stars near left to the head is the group around ["19 Oph"](http://www.www.wikisky.org/?ra=16.786055&de=2.0644445&zoom=6&show_grid=1&show_constellation_lines=1&show_constellation_boundaries=1&show_const_names=0&show_galaxies=1&show_box=1&box_ra=16.786055&box_de=2.0644445&box_width=50&box_height=50).
An eight second [exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed) at 1600 ISO sensor sensivity shows head and tail.

A new observation location with minimum
[light pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution) was found,
possible to go by car to transport all the equipment.
The area often is cold and windy. Double socks and hats and trippled jackets helped to keep the body warm.

Glad to have the opportunity to join that rare event, proud to make use of all collected knowledge and experience.



## 2020-07-10: C/2020 F3 Neowise

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_NEOWISE).

Head and tail was visible pretty fine with the unaided eyes before early morging
[dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn) (3:30 [MESZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Germany)).
The location was in the central area of the
[Swabian Jura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabian_Jura) at an elevation of about 780 meters
[MSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level).

The next bright star upper right of the comet is
['Beta Aurigae'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Aurigae) aka **Menkalinan** in the constellation
[Auriga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auriga), followed by the brighter
[Capella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capella).

Comet and Menkalinan seen to have a similar magnitude of about two!

Thanx to NASA for operating their [WISE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer) space telescope.

## Remarks

Just to mention, additional recommended "tools":
* A red pocket light - avoids dazzling the eyes, when operating on the equipment.
* A [planisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planisphere),
  to become familiar with the situation and the
  [celestial position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_coordinate_systems) of the requested object.
  * [kosmos](https://www.kosmos.de/de/drehbare-kosmos-sternkarte_1080617_9783440154519)
  * [oculum](https://www.oculum-verlag.de/detailview?no=540)
* The [SkEye App for mobile phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lavadip.skeye&hl=de&pli=1)
* Some [muesli bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granola) and water to stay energized.

Recommended literature (old school books made out of paper):
* [Erich Karkoschka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Karkoschka), The Observer's Sky Atlas,
  or in german "Atlas für Himmelsbeobachter", ISBN-13 : 978-3440151471
